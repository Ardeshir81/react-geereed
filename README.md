# React Geereed

React Geereed is a semi-opinionated React Table/DataGrid solution.

Unlike other libraries which render a (customizable) table for you, React Geereed leaves the rendering to you and only provides helpers. (more specifically "hooks")

You can read through the API Reference to learn how to use each hook and how to combine them all together and how to use them to write the table/DataGrid presentation you like.

Also you can see samples/tutorials section to see how you can React Geereed to render a simple HTML table, a Bootstrap one, and a Material one.

## TODO

Unfortunately all you read above is not available right now. ::**grinning**::

For any reason (??!!) that you are here, please come back later.
